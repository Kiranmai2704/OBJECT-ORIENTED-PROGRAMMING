# OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING
To learn the constructs of the Java  programming language along with built-in facilities to create different applications such as  console &amp; graphical user interfaces. In the process of learning the language, they will be  applying knowledge of object-oriented programming; they will get the fundamental knowledge  reason collection framework.

Introduction to OOP: Programming paradigms, procedural programming language versus 
object-oriented language, principles of OOP.
Introduction to JAVA: Data types, variables, keywords, operators, and control statements.
Introduction to Classes and Object: Class definition, variables, and methods. Declaring 
Objects, Constructors, and this keyword.

Classes and objects: overloading methods and constructors, parameter passing, returning 
objects, recursion. Access control, nested and inner classes, final and static keyword, variable 
and command-line arguments.
Inheritance and polymorphism: Inheritance, types of inheritance, super keyword, 
polymorphism (overloading & overriding), dynamic method dispatch, abstract class, using final 
with inheritance.
String handling classes: String, StringBuffer, StringTokenizer.

Interfaces and packages: Interface methods, inheritance in interfaces. API : The built-in JAVA 
packages and creating and managing user defined packages, importance of CLASSPATH.

Exception Handling: Exception hierarchy, importance of try, catch, throw, throws and finally. 
Block creation of user-defined exceptions, Assertions.

Multithreading: Introduction, thread life cycle, creation of threads, naming a thread, joining a 
thread, thread priorities, daemon thread, thread pool, thread group, thread synchronization, Interthread communication. 
Collection Framework: Introduction, generics, collection framework hierarchy, list, set, queue, 
and map.

AWT: AWT hierarchy, components and containers, Button, Label, Text Field, Checkbox, 
Choice, List, Canvas, Scrollbar, Menu Item & Menu, Container class, Layout managers (Border 
Layout, Flow Layout, Grid Layout, Card Layout).
Event handling: Event delegation model, event classes (Action Event, Mouse Event, Key 
Event, Window Event), listener interfaces (Action Listener, Mouse Listener and 
MouseMotionListener, Key Listener, Window Listener), adapter classes, close AWT window.
